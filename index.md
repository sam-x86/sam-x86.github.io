Welcome.

I’m Sam — a cybersecurity enthusiast focused on **ethical hacking and offensive security**.  
This blog documents my journey through tools, techniques, and real-world experiments.

I share what I learn, how things actually work, and how to build a hacker mindset step by step.  
Everything here is practical, intentional, and experience-driven.
